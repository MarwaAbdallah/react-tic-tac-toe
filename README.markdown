# Tic Tac Toe (Final)

This is a Tic Tac Toe game, written with React.
I followed the unofficial react tutorial with hooks based explanations https://reactwithhooks.netlify.app/tutorial/tutorial.html

I was working on CodePen (online coding tool), so the code on this repo also contains plain Javascript (i.e React.createElement) instead of JSX
